<h1>Japanese Markdown User Group</h1>
<p class="lead">The portal to Japanese Markdown users.</p>
<p>We discuss on every topic on Markdown, from daily usage and Markdown syntax to education and accessibility.</p>

<h2>For developers</h2>

<p>If you are a developer of Markdown applications, you can contact us in English.</p>

<p>We can help you testing and debugging issues with Japanese text. We know many Markdown processors have unsolved issues. We also have issues on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method">input methods</a>.</p>

<p>We are interested in <strong>the international standard for Markdown syntax</strong>. If you, too, please join <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/markdown-ja">our google group</a> and feel free to post messages in English. You can also contact us via <a href="mailto:hidetoi@gmail.com">hidetoi@gmail.com</a>.</p>
